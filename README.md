# conventions
A repo containing our best practices and conventions for frontend projects.

## CLI
Install using

```
npm i -g @telenorfrontend/tn-conventions
```

You will be prompted if you'd like autocomplete for the CLI. Your choice really.

### Using the wizard

To initiate a full wizard use the

```
tn-conventions init
```

A wizard will take you through all the available options for our conventions.

### Using specific convention

You can also directly initiate a specific convention through the cli using

```
tn-conventions init [JavaScript|TypeScript|SCSS|Git|Versioning|Editorconfig]
```

This will install the corresponding convention to your project.
