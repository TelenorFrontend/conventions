# Editorconfig

## What is?
[Editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) is a generalized standard for different IDEs to pick up on project structure and configuration. Basically it helps have a common consensus about tabs vs spaces and spacing.

## Tooling
There is nothing else except the .editorconfig-file which needs to be at the project root to function properly.

### Install dependencies

There are two ways to use the `.editorconfig` in this project. The simple way is to copy paste it, which I recommend as when a project structure is set, it's counterproductive to rewrite all code to adhere to a new standard for just tabs and spaces.
