# Versioning

## Versioning
We follow [semver](http://semver.org/) strictly and adheres to the spec given at http://semver.org/.

In short we version accordingly:

- Major - Breaking version which doesn't allow for backwards compitability
- Minor - Introducing new functionality which _doesn't_ break backwards compitability
- Patch - Fixes, no new functionality and non-breaking

### Exceptions
When creating a new project you often start with `v0.1.0`, meaning you haven't "released" a version just yet. This gives some flexibility within semver and it basically means that you can release new versions where minor is major and patch is minor. 

## Tooling
By using [conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) we can use `standard-version` to automagically release a new version for us and create a corresponding changelog since last available release.

### Install dependencies
Install standard-version, the tool to create tags and generate changelogs:

```
npm install --save-dev standard-version
```

### Add release scripts in package.json

```json
scripts: [
  ...
  "release": "standard-version --silent",
  "release:patch": "npm run release -- --release-as patch",
  "release:minor": "npm run release -- --release-as minor",
  "release:major": "npm run release -- --release-as major",
  ...
]
```

### [Optional] First time only

The first release can be generated by typing:

```
npm run release -- --first-release
```

This will keep the current version found in package.json and serve as an initial change log.
